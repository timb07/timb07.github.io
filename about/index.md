## We're destroying the world as we know it

Through mankind's greenhouse gas emissions (chiefly carbon dioxide and methane), we're causing global climate change, increasing the average temperature of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and changing climate patterns.

If you disagree with the above statement (which is the general consensus of 97% of climate scientists) this site is not for you. This site is not an attempt to persuate the so-called climate change deniers who do not accept the established science.

For the rest of you, please read on.

## We should stop destroying the world

Given that we know we're destroying the world, what can we do about it? Obviously we should stop burning fossil fuels, and change how we feed ourselves, and how we build our societies, but those are massive changes, and they're not something that individuals can accomplish by themselves.

So what can we do?

## We should each do what's required

If everyone in the developed world followed the suggestions on this site, we would limit atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and hence, over time, keep climate change to a "safe" level. At least, that is the aim of this site, and with various provisos as well (such as developing nations also taking responsible actions).

But really, I don't know what is required, so this site is about exploring possible actions, and asking the question, if everyone did this, would it be enough?
